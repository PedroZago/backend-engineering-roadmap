# Backend Engineering Roadmap

This repository documents my journey to become a **backend specialist focused on Node.js, TypeScript, and cloud-native architectures**.

The main goal is to build **strong engineering foundations**, master **scalable backend architectures**, and develop **production-ready systems** aligned with industry best practices.

## Objectives

- Master Node.js and TypeScript at a deep technical level
- Build scalable and maintainable backend architectures
- Develop secure, high-performance APIs
- Gain strong experience with AWS and cloud-native systems
- Prepare for senior and international backend engineering roles

## What you will find here

- Technical notes and summaries
- Hands-on experiments and proof of concepts
- Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Performance benchmarks
- Security implementations
- Cloud infrastructure experiments
- End-to-end backend projects

## Main Topics

- Node.js internals and async programming
- Advanced TypeScript patterns
- NestJS architecture and modular design
- Database modeling and performance
- API design and best practices
- Testing strategies
- Backend security
- Clean Architecture and DDD principles
- Performance optimization and scalability
- AWS and cloud infrastructure

## Projects

- **nestjs-clean-architecture-api** — Enterprise-grade API built with NestJS, focusing on architecture, security, testing and AWS deployment.
- **nodejs-scalable-backend** — High-performance backend focused on scalability, async processing, caching and observability.
