# Backend Engineering Roadmap

This repository documents my journey to become a backend specialist focused on
Node.js, TypeScript and cloud-native architectures.

The goal of this roadmap is to:
- Build strong backend foundations
- Master scalable architectures
- Develop production-ready systems
- Prepare for senior and international roles

This roadmap includes:
- Study notes
- Hands-on exercises
- Architecture experiments
- Technical decisions
- Real-world projects

The content evolves continuously as I grow as a backend engineer.
